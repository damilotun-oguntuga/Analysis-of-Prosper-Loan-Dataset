## by Oluwadamilotun Kehinde Oguntuga


## Dataset

> The Prosper Loan dataset contains one hundred and thirteen thousand records of loans given by Prosper. It contains the details of the borrower information and how the loans are being serviced. It also documents the variables surrounding the borrowing of the loans such as the number of investors, monthly loan payments. The dataset contains a risk score known as the Prosper Score issued by prosper to assess the borrowers based on past loans.


## Summary of Findings

> After the data wrangling process, about eighty four thousand entries were left and these were analysed under twelve variables (columns) to determine the major factors that affect the scheduled monthly loan payment. In this analysis, it was discovered that there exist a strong positive correlation between the number of investors and the scheduled monthly loan payment. Other factors that positively affect the scheduled monthly loan payment are employment status because the fully employed loanees had higher average monthly payment and the those employed part-time had the lowest average monthly loan payment, debt-to-income ratio because those with debt-to-income that were close to had the highest scheduled monthly loan payment, and the term of the loans.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> The distribution of the scheduled monthly loan payment appeared to be bimodal and right-skewwed. Most of the values were concentrated below 600 and the modal payment appeared to be 200. 
> In the plot of the average monthly loan payment versus the employment status it was observed that loanees who were employed full time had the highest average monthly loan payment which was about 300 and the loanees who were employed part time had the lowest average monthly loan payment which was about 150. 
> In the plot of Average Scheduled Monthly Loan Payment vs Employment Status for Each Loan Term it was observed that loanees who took the loans are self employed and took the loans for 12 months had the highest  average scheduled monthly loan payment which was around 450. Also, from this plot it was noticed that took the loan for 36 months paid the lowest average monthly loan payment for all employment statuses. 
> In the plot of Scheduled Monthly Loan Payment vs Number of Investors it was discovered that most of the loanees paid less that 500 monthly loan payment and had less than 100 investors.
> In the plot of Monthly Loan Payments by Number of Investors and Debt-to-Income Ratio, it showed that highest scheduled monthly loan payment came from loanees with less that 0.5 debt-to-income ratio and with no investors. This is surprising because one will expect that those with many investors will pay higher. However, this may be attributed to the fact that many loanees could not secure many investors. Other factors may also be affecting this and hence, more research and analysis will help to uncover the reason for the disjoint in the number of investors and scheduled monthly loan payment.
> In the plot of the Scheduled Monthly Loan Payment vs Number of Investors for Each Term, it was observed that the highest scheduled monthly loan payment comes from loanees that took the loan for 36 months. Surprisingly, as we noted in the previous insight, they had no investor.
